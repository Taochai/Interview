A Framework for Defining Differentially-Private Computations
3 important chanllenges:
  1. difficulty of designing utility-optimal algorithms
  2. diversity， hard to used in different mission.
  3. incorrectly implemented algorithms
5 contributions:
  1.operator set
  2.proof of privacy
  3. modularity, transparency, flexibility
  
Algorithm 1:
problem： AHPpartition, privacy budget,
